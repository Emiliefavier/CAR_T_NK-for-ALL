Comparison of efficacy and toxicity of CAR T and NK therapy treatments for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Codes used for model simulations.
To perform simulations, you need to take the "simulations" file with the corresponding "commands" file, and run the commands file.
For example, to simulate the CAR T model, "simulations_ODE_model_T.m" goes with "commands_simulateODE_T.m", and you need to run "commands_simulateODE_T"
